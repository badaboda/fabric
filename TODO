1   Ctrl-C dosn't quite work... especially not with the tail example
9   make parallel submode work
11  add built-in help for built-in variables
    - and modes and submodes
13  reduce print & exit() statements to as few functions as possible
14  also comment internal/private functions, if only a little

    - SCM support should be done entirely in plugins

30  Update commands to store "local" scope of some kind, such as underscored
    helper methods which currently get stripped out entirely.
31  Figure out how to deal with the use of different @hosts lists when running
    more than one command in a single session.
32  Glob patterns on put() and download(), like put('*.html', 'to/some/path')
